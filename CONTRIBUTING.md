# Contributing to LRLogic

Thanks for wanting to help out. Here’s what you need to know:

- Fork and clone the repo.
- You’ll need Go installed
- Python 3 with `svg.path` is needed for helper scripts.
- Use the included install scripts to set up dependencies quickly.
- Tests are welcome but not mandatory.
- If you change behavior or add features, update the README or docs.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Submit pull requests with a short explanation.
- Report bugs or suggestions via mail.

This project is unsimple and direct,
That’s it. Keep it simple and focused, unlike the project.

Thanks for helping make LRLogic better!
