Hello there random person welcome to my git repository!
Infront of you there is a complicated piece of software that i named LRLogic.
Its logical you know. And the reason i made it is because im autistic enough to understand the pure vectors and i will preffer this renderer over using mspaint.
And since i dont want this repo to be completely useless i added a random generator so you can experiment with this too.
Just modify the .lrlogic file and see what you can create. This is basically ai art before the training phase. And its mathematical too.
And if you want to incorporate this thing into your software you can since its open-source.
Well as much as the GPL allows it to be used. And by the way LR stands for line-replicator an older project of mine (dont look for it, you wont find it).
It did what the name suggested it does. This is basically that but.... way more complicated.
And thanks to the wonderful GoLang it runs very fast. Exept for the random generator because thats made in python for some reason. Anyway im out.
