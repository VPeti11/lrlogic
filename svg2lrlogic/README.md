# LRLogic SVG2LR converter
As the name implies this directory contains programs used to convert SVG files into .lrlogic files
## Whats the difference between the formats
Not a lot honestly. Its just one is an XML format and the other one is meant to tear your brain appart. Well not for me atleast. The .lrlogic format is still more readable than SVG files. But structurewise the formats are both vector formats and they both need to be rendered. But .lrlogic files get translated into .svg files for better compatibility and get rendered after. I could make a straight up renderer but i wont
## Why are there 2 converters here?
They are used for different .svg input files. Heres the difference
### Go based 
This is used to reverse convert .lrlogic files that are for exaple generated by LRLogic or just contain simple squares and circles or lines made in a vector drawing program. Of course if you make a .lrlogic file into an SVG file and put it trough this converter it wouldnt produce the exact same results but the image would look the same
### Python based
The only reason that i used Python is due to library. Thats it. Anyway this converter is useful for XML transform SVG elements. If that sounds like something out of Star Wars your not alone. Its basically what programs like Inkscape use to convert a raster image (for example a JPG) into a vector image (SVG in this case). The program renders the image and trough the magic of torturing your CPU it produces lines
